            <p>What's up, player?  Welcome to Hoop Squad, an app built around the majestic sport of basketball, courtesy of the 
                VBA (or the "Vitual Basketball Association").
            </p>

            <p>We at the VBA realize how many people dream of becoming legendary basketball players, but let's face the facts.  
                The average player lacks the skills, knowledge, endurance, resources, and ambition to go pro, let alone earn a 
                spot in the hall of fame.  However, the Virtual Basketball Association is devoted to at least motivating you into 
                continuing your pursuit for basketball immortality.  Oh...and if it means anything to you, everyone else in this 
                forum is here to step their game up, too.  No need to feel ashamed, player.  Just think of yourself as being part 
                of a team that is playing to win a championship.</p>

            <h1 class="header">Playbook Strategy</h1>
            <img src="./images/scoreboard.jpg" class="img-buzzer" alt="container image3">
            <p>Hoop Squad allows players like you to post questions onto a forum, which can be answered by other players.  Not 
                only can you receive answers, you can also answer other players' questions.  All we ask is that you keep your 
                posts clean.  You wouldn't want to get hit with a technical foul and sent to the bench, would you?  Of course not.  
                No self-respecting player wants to be a benchwarmer.</p>
