# project-5

Name:  Jordan Woodard

Project Description:  This project involves creating a forum where users can submit their own questions and respond to other users' questions with answers.  The app that contains the forum is called "Hoop Squad", and it follows a basketball theme.  As a result, all of the questions posted on the app will be related to basketball.

Comments:  The Hoop Squad app is made up of four pages:  Home, Registration, Login, and Dashboard.  When it comes to the layout, each page consists of a navbar and containers for the introductory text, the forms, and other additional information.  In particular, the Home and the Dashboard pages feature links on the right side of the navbar, with the Home page holding two links (one to the Registration page and one to the Login page) and the Dashboard page holding just the Login link.  There is a button on the Home page that is supposed to take the user to the Contact page, but an alert box shows up when clicking on it.  The Registration and Login pages also have buttons that take the user back to the Home page.

Technologies:  html, css, js, react, express, sql
